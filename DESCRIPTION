Description: this package provides three approaches to solve the knapsack problem which includes brute force algorithm,
      Greedy Heuristic approach and dynamic programming. On large datasets these aproaches slow down to increase the
      performance we also implemented parallelism in brute force approach which uses all cores of the system to maxmize
      the performance.
